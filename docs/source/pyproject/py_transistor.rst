2.15 Two Kinds of Transistors
==========================================

In this lesson, we'll explore two types of transistors: the **S8050 (NPN)** and the **S8550 (PNP)**. Transistors are commonly used as electronic switches, and weâ€™ll see how both types can be used to control an LED with a button.

|img_NPN&PNP|

* **NPN (S8050)**: This type of transistor allows current to flow from the **collector** to the **emitter** when a high signal is applied to the **base**.
* **PNP (S8550)**: For PNP transistors, current flows from the **emitter** to the **collector** when a low signal is applied to the **base**.


While both transistors serve similar purposes, they behave oppositely when it comes to signal control. Letâ€™s use these transistors to control an LED based on button input.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components.

**Way to connect NPN (S8050) transistor**

|sch_s8050|

In this circuit, pressing the button sends a **high signal** to the GP14 pin. When GP15 outputs a high signal, the NPN transistor conducts, allowing current to flow through the LED, lighting it up.

**Way to connect PNP(S8550) transistor**

|sch_s8550|

For the PNP transistor circuit, the button starts with a low signal on GP14 and changes to high when pressed. When GP15 outputs a **low signal**, the PNP transistor conducts, allowing current to flow and lighting up the LED.

|wiring_s8550|



**Writing the Code**

Both the NPN and PNP transistors can be controlled with the same code. The button's status is read, and depending on whether it's pressed or not, the Pico outputs a high or low signal to GP15.

.. note::

    * Open the ``2.15_transistor.py`` from ``pico-2w-starter-kit-main/micropython`` or copy the code into Thonny, then click "Run" or press F5.
    * Ensure the correct interpreter is selected: MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico).COMxx. 
    

.. code-block:: python

    import machine

    # Initialize the button and signal pins
    button = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.IN)
    signal = machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.OUT)

    while True:
        button_status = button.value()
        if button_status == 1:
            signal.value(1)  # Send high signal to the transistor
        else:
            signal.value(0)  # Send low signal to the transistor


**Results**

* NPN Circuit (S8050):

  The LED lights up when the button is pressed because the NPN transistor conducts when a high signal is applied to its base.

* PNP Circuit (S8550):

  The LED lights up when the button is released because the PNP transistor conducts when a low signal is applied to its base.

Both circuits demonstrate how transistors can be used to control current flow based on different types of signals.

**Conclusion**

By experimenting with these two transistors, you gain a better understanding of how NPN and PNP transistors function and how to use them in circuits to control electronic devices.
