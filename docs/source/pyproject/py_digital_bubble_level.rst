7.12 Building a Digital Bubble Level
==========================================

In this project, we'll create a **Digital Bubble Level** using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module, and an 8x8 LED matrix display controlled by two 74HC595 shift registers. This device functions similarly to a traditional spirit level, indicating the tilt of a surface. As you tilt the MPU6050, a "bubble" represented by LEDs on the matrix will move accordingly, allowing you to visualize the levelness of a surface.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components.

**Understanding the Components**

* **MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope**: Provides acceleration and angular velocity data along three axes (X, Y, Z), which we'll use to calculate the tilt angles.
* **8x8 LED Matrix Display**: An array of LEDs arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns, allowing us to display patterns or images by controlling individual LEDs.
* **74HC595 Shift Registers**: Allows us to control multiple outputs (in this case, the rows and columns of the LED matrix) using fewer GPIO pins on the Pico.

**Schematic**

|sch_bubble_level|

The MPU6050 takes the acceleration values in each direction and calculates the attitude angle.

As a result, the program draws a 2x2 dot on the dot matrix based on data from the two 74HC595 chips.

As the attitude angle changes, the program sends different data to the 74HC595 chips, and the position of the dot changes, creating a bubble effect.

**Wiring**


|wiring_digital_bubble_level| 


**Writing the Code**

We'll write a MicroPython script that:

* Reads acceleration data from the MPU6050.
* Calculates the tilt angles along the X and Y axes.
* Maps the tilt angles to positions on the 8x8 LED matrix.
* Displays a "bubble" (a 2x2 pixel representation) that moves according to the tilt.

.. note::

    * Open the ``7.12_digital_bubble_level.py`` from ``pico-2 w-kit-main/micropython`` or copy the code into Thonny, then click "Run" or press F5.
    * Ensure the correct interpreter is selected: MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico).COMxx. 
    * Here you need to use the ``imu.py`` and ``vector3d.py``, please check if it has been uploaded to Pico, for a detailed tutorial refer to :ref:`add_libraries_py`.

When the code runs, place the setup on a level surface.
The bubble (a 2x2 pixel area) should appear at the center of the LED matrix.
Tilt the breadboard or the MPU6050 module.
Observe the bubble moving on the LED matrix in the direction of the tilt, simulating a real bubble level.

**Understanding the Code**

   * Initializes a fresh 8x8 matrix with all LEDs turned on (value ``1``).
   * Gets the current bubble position from ``bubble_position()``.
   * Updates the matrix with ``drop_bubble()`` to reflect the bubble's new position.
   * Converts the matrix to a glyph using ``matrix_2_glyph()``.
   * Displays the glyph on the LED matrix with ``display()``.
   * Waits for 0.1 seconds before repeating to control the update rate.

**Troubleshooting**

* LED Matrix Not Displaying Correctly:

  * Check all wiring connections between the shift registers and the LED matrix.
  * Ensure that the shift registers are connected properly to the Pico.
  * Verify that the common anode or cathode configuration of your LED matrix matches the code logic.

* Incorrect Bubble Movement:

  * Ensure the MPU6050 is properly connected and functioning.
  * Check that the MPU6050 is correctly oriented.

* Program Errors:

  * Ensure that ``imu.py`` and ``vector3d.py`` are correctly uploaded.
  * Check for typos or indentation errors in the code.

**Experimenting Further**

* Adjust Sensitivity:

  Modify the mapping of angles to positions to change the sensitivity of the bubble movement.

* Display Enhancements:

  * Change the size or shape of the bubble.
  * Add visual effects, such as trails or different patterns.

* Calibration:

  Implement a calibration routine to set the zero point when the device is placed on an uneven surface.

* Alternative Displays:

  Use an OLED or LCD display to show numerical angle values in addition to the visual bubble.

**Conclusion**

You've successfully built a Digital Bubble Level using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W! This project demonstrates how accelerometer data can be used to visualize orientation and tilt, and how to control an LED matrix display using shift registers.

Feel free to expand upon this project by adding new features or integrating it into larger systems.
