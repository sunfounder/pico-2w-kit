7.9 Building a Fruit Piano
=================================================

In this project, we'll create a **Fruit Piano** using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2w, an MPR121 capacitive touch sensor, a buzzer, and an RGB LED. By connecting fruits (or any conductive objects) to the capacitive touch sensor, we'll transform them into piano keys that play musical notes and display colorful lights when touched.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components.

**Understanding the Components**

*  **MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor**: A capacitive touch sensor controller that can handle up to 12 touch inputs. It detects changes in capacitance caused by touching connected electrodes.
*  **Passive Buzzer**: An electronic component that produces sound when driven with a PWM signal. We'll use it to play different musical notes.
*  **RGB LED**: An LED that combines red, green, and blue LEDs into one package. By adjusting the intensity of each color, we can produce a wide range of colors.
*  **Fruits or Conductive Objects**: Items like fruits, metal objects, or even water can act as conductive touch inputs when connected to the MPR121.

**Schematic**

|sch_fruit_piano| 

To turn the fruit into a piano key, you still need to connect the electrodes on the MPR121 to the fruit (e.g. into the banana handle).

In the beginning, MPR121 will initialize and each electrode will get a value based on the current charge; when a conductor (such as a human body) touches an electrode, the charge will shift and rebalance.
As a result, the electrode's value is different from its initial value, telling the main control board that it has been touched.
During this process, ensure that the wiring of each electrode is stable so that its charge is balanced when initializing.


**Wiring**


|wiring_fruit_piano| 


**Writing the Code**

We'll write a MicroPython script that:

* Initializes the MPR121 touch sensor.
* Detects touch inputs from the connected fruits.
* Plays corresponding musical notes on the buzzer.
* Lights up the RGB LED with random colors.

.. note::

    * Open the ``7.9_fruit_piano.py`` from ``pico-2w-starter-kit-main/micropython`` or copy the code into Thonny, then click "Run" or press F5.
    * Ensure the correct interpreter is selected: MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico).COMxx. 
    * Here you need to use the library called ``mpr121.py``, please check if it has been uploaded to Pico, for a detailed tutorial refer to :ref:`add_libraries_py`.

.. note::
    
    Do not touch the fruits or conductive objects before running the program to ensure proper initialization.

After the program starts, gently touch the fruits.

* The buzzer will play the corresponding musical note.
* The RGB LED will light up with a random color.
* Experiment by touching different fruits to play different notes.

**Understanding the Code**

#. Initialization:

   * **I2C Connection**: Sets up communication with the MPR121 sensor.
   * **PWM Setup**: Initializes PWM for the buzzer and RGB LED pins.

#. Note Frequencies:

   A list of frequencies corresponding to musical notes (A3 to E5).

#. Functions:

   * ``play_tone(frequency)``: Starts playing a tone at the specified frequency.
   * ``stop_tone()``: Stops the buzzer.
   * ``set_random_color()``: Sets the RGB LED to a random color.
   * ``turn_off_led()``: Turns off the RGB LED.

#. Main Loop:

   * **Touch Detection**: Continuously checks for touch events on the electrodes.
   * **Touch Handling**:

     * When an electrode is touched, plays the corresponding note and lights up the RGB LED.
     * When an electrode is released, stops the tone and turns off the LED.

   * **Debouncing**: A short delay (``time.sleep(0.01)``) to prevent bouncing issues.

#. Exception Handling:

   * Uses a try block to allow for graceful exit on a keyboard interrupt.
   * Ensures that the buzzer and LED are turned off in the finally block.


**Troubleshooting**

* No Sound or Lights:

  * Check all wiring connections.
  * Ensure that the MPR121 is properly connected to the Pico.
  * Verify that the fruits are connected securely to the electrodes.
  * Ensure that ``mpr121.py`` is correctly uploaded to the Pico.

* Touch Not Detected:

  * Make sure you're not touching multiple electrodes simultaneously.
  * Avoid touching the wires directly; touch the fruits or conductive objects.
  * Ensure that the fruits are not too dry; moist fruits conduct better.

* Unstable Behavior:

  * Ensure that the Pico and sensor are not exposed to static electricity.
  * Keep the wires and connections stable to maintain consistent capacitance readings.

**Experimenting Further**

* Expand the Instrument:

  * Use different conductive materials (e.g., water, metal objects) to act as keys.
  * Increase the number of notes by mapping more frequencies to the electrodes.

* Visual Effects:

  * Modify the ``set_random_color()`` function to create specific color patterns.
  * Add more LEDs to enhance the visual experience.

* Adjust Sensitivity:

  Experiment with the MPR121's touch threshold settings to adjust sensitivity.

* Combine with Other Sensors:

  Integrate other sensors (e.g., light sensors) to modify the sound or light effects based on environmental conditions.

**Conclusion**

You've successfully built a Fruit Piano using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2w! This project demonstrates how capacitive touch sensing can be combined with sound and light to create interactive experiences. It's a fun way to explore the principles of conductivity, touch sensing, and creative coding.

Feel free to expand upon this project by adding new features, experimenting with different materials, or integrating additional components.
