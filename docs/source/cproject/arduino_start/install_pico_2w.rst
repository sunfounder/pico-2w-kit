1.3 Setting Up the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W (Important)
=====================================================

1. Installing the Board Package
--------------------------------------

To program the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, you need to install the appropriate board package in the Arduino IDE. Follow these steps to get started:

#. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to **File** -> **Preferences**.

#. Once the installation is complete, a notification will appear to confirm the successful setup.

2. Selecting the Board and Port
------------------------------------------

#. Hold down the **BOOTSEL** button, then unplug your Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and quickly plug it back in.

   .. warning::
        
      * This step is crucial, especially for first-time users on the Arduino IDE. Skipping this step will result in a failed upload.
      * Once you've successfully uploaded the code, your Pico will be recognized by the computer. For future uploads, simply plug it into the computer without holding the button.

#. To select the appropriate board, go to **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Raspberry Pi Pico /RP2040/PR2350** -> **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**.

2. Next, select the correct port by navigating to **Tools** -> **Port** -> **UF2 Board**.

   .. note::
     
     * For the first connection or when holding the **BOOTSEL** button, choose **UF2 Board**.
     * After successfully uploading the code, your Pico 2W will be recognized by the computer. For future uses, select the corresponding **COMxx (Raspberry Pi Pico 2)**.

3. Uploading Code
--------------------------

Now, let's move on to uploading code to your Raspberry Pi Pico 2w.

#. Open any ``.ino`` file, or use the blank sketch that appears by default. Then, click the **Upload** button.
