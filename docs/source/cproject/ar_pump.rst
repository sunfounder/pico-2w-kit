3.6 Controlling a Water Pump
=============================

In this lesson, we'll learn how to control a **small water pump** using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W and an **TA6586 motor driver**. A small centrifugal pump can be used for projects like automatic plant watering systems or creating miniature water features. Controlling the pump is similar to controlling a DC motor, as it uses the same principles.

**Schematic**

**Wiring**

.. note::

    * Since pump require a high current, we use a Li-po Charger module to power the motor here for safety reasons.
    * Make sure your Li-po Charger Module is connected as shown in the diagram. Otherwise, a short circuit will likely damage your battery and circuitry.

**Code**

.. note::

    * You can open the file ``3.6_pumping.ino`` under the path of ``pico-2w-kit-main/arduino/3.6_pumping``. 
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
    * Don't forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the **Upload** button.

    
.. code-block:: Arduino

    const int motor1A = 14; // Motor control pin 1
    const int motor2A = 15; // Motor control pin 2

    void setup() {
      // Set motor control pins as OUTPUT
      pinMode(motor1A, OUTPUT); // Configure motor1A as an output pin
      pinMode(motor2A, OUTPUT); // Configure motor2A as an output pin
    }

    void loop() {
      // Rotate the motor in a clockwise direction
      digitalWrite(motor1A, HIGH); // Set motor1A to HIGH (activates one side of the motor)
      digitalWrite(motor2A, LOW);  // Set motor2A to LOW (deactivates the opposite side of the motor)
    }




After the code is run, the pump starts working and you will see water flowing out of the tube at the same time.
* This cycle repeats indefinitely.
* If water doesn't flow initially, make sure the pump is submerged, and there are no air bubbles in the tubing.


**Safety Precautions**

* Water and Electricity:

  * Be extremely careful to keep water away from the Pico and other electronic components.
  * Ensure all connections are secure and insulated if necessary.

* Power Supply:

  * Use a power supply that matches the pump's voltage requirements (typically 3V-6V).
  * Do not power the pump directly from the Pico's 3.3V pin.

* Current Draw:

  * Pumps can draw significant current.
  * Ensure your power source can handle the pump's current requirements.

* Resetting the Pico:

  If you encounter issues uploading code after running the pump, you can manually reset the Pico by connecting the RUN pin to GND momentarily.

**Further Exploration**

* Automated Plant Watering:

  Incorporate soil moisture sensors to automate the watering process based on soil dryness.

* PWM Speed Control:

  Use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the pump's speed by varying the voltage.

* Timing and Scheduling:

  Implement more complex timing using real-time clocks or schedulers.

**Conclusion**

In this lesson, you've learned how to control a small water pump using the Raspberry Pi Pico and the TA6586 motor driver. This technique can be used in various projects like automated plant watering systems, fountains, or hydroponic setups.
