**Understanding the DHT11 Sensor**

The **DHT11** sensor uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air. It outputs a digital signal on the data pin, and it's fairly simple to use, but requires precise timing to read data.

* Temperature Range: 0â€“50 Â°C with Â±2 Â°C accuracy
* Humidity Range: 20â€“80% RH with Â±5% accuracy
* Sampling Rate: 1 Hz (once every second)

**Schematic**

|sch_dht11|

**Wiring**

|wiring_dht11|


**Writing the Code**

We'll write a program that reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor and prints the values to the Serial Monitor.


.. note::

    * You can open the file ``6.2_dht11.ino`` under the path of ``pico-2w-starter-kit-main/arduino/6.2_dht11``. 
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
    * Then select the Raspberry Pi Pico board and the correct port before clicking the Upload button.
    * The ``DHT sensor library`` library is used here, you can install it from the **Library Manager**.

    // Create a DHT object
    DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

    unsigned long previousMillis = 0; // Stores the last time the display was updated
    const long interval = 2000;        // Interval at which to read sensor (milliseconds)

    void setup() {
      // Initialize serial communication at 115200 baud
      Serial.begin(115200);
      Serial.println(F("DHT11 Sensor Test!"));
    
      // Initialize the DHT sensor
      dht.begin();

      // Update the sensor reading every 'interval' milliseconds
      if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
        previousMillis = currentMillis;

        // Read humidity and temperature
        float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
        float temperatureC = dht.readTemperature();
        float temperatureF = dht.readTemperature(true);

        // Check if any reads failed
        if (isnan(humidity) || isnan(temperatureC) || isnan(temperatureF)) {
          Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
          return;
        }

        // Calculate heat index
        float heatIndexC = dht.computeHeatIndex(temperatureC, humidity, false);
        float heatIndexF = dht.computeHeatIndex(temperatureF, humidity);

        // Print the results to the Serial Monitor
        Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
        Serial.print(humidity);
        Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
        Serial.print(temperatureC);
        Serial.print(F("Â°C "));

        Serial.print(heatIndexF);
        Serial.println(F("Â°F"));
      }
    }

After uploading the code, the Serial Monitor should display the temperature and humidity readings every two seconds.

        #define DHTTYPE DHT11    // Define the sensor type

#. Creating the ``DHT`` Object:

   Initializes a ``DHT`` object with the specified data pin and sensor type.

   .. code-block:: arduino

     .. code-block:: arduino
   
        if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
          previousMillis = currentMillis;

     .. code-block:: arduino
   
        Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
        Serial.print(humidity);
        Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
        Serial.print(temperatureC);
        Serial.print(F("Â°C "));
        Serial.print(temperatureF);
        Serial.print(F("Â°F  Heat index: "));
        Serial.print(heatIndexC);
        Serial.print(F("Â°C "));
        Serial.print(heatIndexF);
        Serial.println(F("Â°F"));

**Troubleshooting**

* No Readings Displayed:

  * Check all wiring connections.
  * Ensure the DHT11 sensor is receiving power.
  * Verify that the correct GPIO pins are defined in the code.

* Incorrect Readings:

  * Verify that the DHT11 sensor is not damaged.
  * Check the sensor's datasheet for proper timing and signal requirements.

* Sensor Interference:

  * Avoid placing the sensor near other electronic devices that might cause interference.
  * Ensure there are no obstacles blocking the sensor's line of sight.

**Further Exploration**

* Integrating with Displays:

  Connect an LCD or OLED display to show temperature and humidity readings without using the Serial Monitor.

* Creating Alerts:

  Implement buzzer or notification systems that trigger when temperature or humidity exceeds certain thresholds.

* Combining with Other Sensors:

  Pair the DHT11 with motion sensors, light sensors, or other environmental sensors to create comprehensive monitoring systems.

* Building a Weather Station:

  Expand the project by adding additional sensors like barometric pressure sensors, rain gauges, and wind speed sensors to build a full-fledged weather station.

**Conclusion**

In this lesson, you've learned how to use a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico to measure and display ambient temperature and humidity levels. By leveraging the DHT library, you can easily integrate environmental sensing into your projects. The optional LED indicator provides a simple way to add visual feedback based on sensor readings, enhancing the interactivity of your system.
