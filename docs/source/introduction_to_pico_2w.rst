Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
=======================================

|pico_2w_side|

Raspberry Pi Pico 2W features 2.4GHz 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 5.2, giving you even more flexibility in your IoT or smart product designs and expanding the possibilities for your projects.
It is able to operate in both station andaccess-point modes. Full access to network functionality is available to both C andMicroPython developers.
Raspberry Pi Pico 2W pairs RP2350 with 4MB of flash memory, and a power supply chip
supporting input voltages from 1.8‚Äì5.5V. It provides 26 GPIO pins, three of which can
function as analogue inputs, on 0.1‚Äù-pitch through-hole pads with castellated edges.
Raspberry Pi Pico 2W is available as an individual unit, or in 480-unit reels for automated
assembly.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 3 5 10
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Name
        - Description
        - Function
    *   - GP0-GP28
        - General-purpose input/output pins
        - Act as either input or output and have no fixed purpose of their own
    *   - GND
        - 0 volts ground
        - Several GND pins around Pico 2W to make wiring easier.
    *   - RUN
        - Enables or diables your Pico
        - Start and stop your Pico 2W from another microcontroller.
    *   - GPxx_ADCx
        - General-purpose input/output or analog input
        - Used as an analog input as well as a digital input or output ‚Äì but not both at the same time.
    *   - ADC_VREF
        - Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) voltage reference
        - A special input pin which sets a reference voltage for any analog inputs.
    *   - AGND
        - Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 0 volts ground
        - A special ground connection for use with the ADC_VREF pin.
    *   - 3V3(O)
        - 3.3 volts power
        - A source of 3.3V power, the same voltage your Pico 2W runs at internally, generated from the VSYS input.
    *   - 3v3(E)
        - Enables or disables the power
        - Switch on or off the 3V3(O) power, can also switches your Pico 2W off.
    *   - VSYS
        - 2-5 volts power
        - A pin directly connected to your Pico's internal power supply, which cannot be switched off without also switching Pico 2W off.
    *   - VBUS
        - 5 volts power
        - A source of 5 V power taken from your Pico's micro USB port, and used to power hardware which needs more than 3.3 V.
