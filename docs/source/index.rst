Thank you for choosing the SunFounder Pico 2 W Starter Kit

The Pico 2 W Kit is a comprehensive learning and development kit built around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W microcontroller. 
It comes equipped with a variety of modules, including sensors (ultrasonic, RFID, MPU6050, water level), display components 
(LEDs, dot matrix, 7-segment display, I2C LCD1602), and actuators like motors, servos, and pumps. This kit is designed to 
enable users to explore hardware programming, interactive projects, and creative designs.
This documentation is divided into two sections based on the programming environment:

* :ref:`projects_micropython`: Learn to program and control the kit using MicroPython, focusing on hands-on examples and hardware interaction.
* :ref:`projects_arduino`: Utilize the Arduino IDE and C/C++ programming to achieve the same hardware functionality through structured exercises and projects.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, the Pico 2 W Kit provides all the tools and guidance you need to start building exciting projects.

Please feel free to e-mail us if you are interested in learning other projects we don't have. We will update our online tutorials as soon as possible.
